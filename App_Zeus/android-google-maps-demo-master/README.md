android-google-maps-demo
========================

A simple to START/STOP the car and Send Destination co-ordinates to Zeus. Has static Google maps Api. 

Before starting the app the API-key needs to be set. You can go to google cloud platform to get your personalised API-key for any project.


The Google Maps Api helps us to lay down the map into our Android App. It can have different types of map like satellite, terrain and many more. Adding these features on the map helps us to add cool features to our app and make our app able to guide to places to which the user wants.

Make sure that you've setup your Android API key (com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY) in manifests/AndroidManifest.xml!  Otherwise, you may not find the maps rendering.
